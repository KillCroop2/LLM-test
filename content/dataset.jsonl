research specifically analyzes the impact of ChatGPT on the velocity of software development finding that the availability of ChatGPT", "Significantly increased the number of Git pushes per  inhabitants of each country", "Had a positive although not statistically significant correlation with the number of repositories and developers per  inhabitants", "Generally enhanced developer engagement across various programming languages Highlevel languages like Python and JavaScript showed significant increases in unique developers while the impact on domainspecific languages like HTML and SQL varied", "These results would imply that the impact of ChatGPT thus far does not lie in the increase of developers or projects but in an acceleration of the preestablished development process", "GitHubs Innovation Graph data worked very well with the methods we used especially the synthetic ones Having country and languagelevel aggregated data meant that we could neatly define our control and treatment groups and disaggregate them again to find how effects differed say by language There actually are several other disaggregations we could do with this data and we might look into that in the future but the language differences seemed like the most obvious faceting approach to explore", "Interesting Could you provide an overview of the methods you used in your analysis", "We mainly focused on comparative methods for panel data in observational studies with the goal of estimating the average treatment effect Our main method used synthetic difference in differences SDID as described by Arkhangelsky Athey Imbens and Wager  We also described the results for the difference in differences DiD and synthetic control SC methods", "Nice Followup question could you provide an

predicting posttreatment levels in the control group Visually both groups are nearly parallel before the launch of ChatGPT but start noticeably diverging after the launch We can interpret the average treatment effect as the magnitude of this divergence", "Synthetic differenceindifferences SDID estimatesnumber of pushers per k inhabitants by programming language", "here we present the estimated treatment effect by language the squares represent the estimates and the lines represent their  confidence intervals All the results shown here are statistically significant although some are very small The estimated treatment effects are larger for JavaScript Python TypeScript Shell HTML and CSS and smaller for Rust C C Assembly Batchfile PowerShell R MATLAB and PLpgSQL", "A full explanation of DiD SC and SDID probably wouldnt fit in this QA although see additional learning resources at the bottom but walking through our analysis briefly I preferred the SDID method for our analysis because the parallel trends assumption required for the DiD method did not hold for our treatment and control groups Additionally the SC method could not be precise due to our limited data for pretreatment periods only eleven quarters The SDID method addresses these limitations by constructing a synthetic control group while also considering pretreatment period differences making it a robust choice for our analysis", "Id be curious about the limitations of your paper and data that you wished you had for further work What would the ideal datasets look like for you", "During my presentation at the Summer Institute in Munich some researchers critiqued our methodology by highlighting that even if countries faced restrictions on ChatGPT individuals might have used VPNs to bypass these restrictions This potential workaround could undermine the validity of using these countries as a control group However I referred to studies by Kreitmeir and Raschky  and del RioChanona et al  which acknowledged that while VPNs allow access to ChatGPT these barriers still pose significant hurdles to widespread and rapid adoption Therefore the restrictions remain a valid consideration in our analysis", "I would like to conduct a similar analysis using administrative data at the software developer level Specifically I aim to compare the increase in productivity for those who have access to GitHub Copilot with those who do not Additionally if we could obtain user experience metrics we could explore heterogeneous results among users leveraging Copilot This data would enable us

software engineering and research starting out can be overwhelming because there is a lot you dont know We can also fall into optimization paralysis when we try to figure out the optimal course of

draganddrop to perform tasks like uploading files reordering browser bookmarks or even moving a card in solitaire It can be hard to imagine completing most of these tasks without a mouse and even

Screen readers use arrow keys to navigate through content", "One of the very first challenges we faced involved setting up an interaction model for moving an item through keyboard navigation We chose

webpage", " Arrow keys are commonly used by screen readers to help users navigate through content like reading text or navigating between cells in a table Consequently when we tested draganddrop with

Announcing movements in rapid succession", "Once we had our keyboard operations working our next big obstacle was", " in particular announcing rapid movements of a selected item", "To prepare for external user testing we tested our announcements ourselves with screen readers Because we are not native screen reader users we moved items slowly throughout the page and the announcements sounded great However users typically move items rapidly to complete tasks quickly so our screen reader testing did not reflect how users would actually interact with our feature", " It was not until user testing that we discovered that when a user moved an item in rapid succession the", "announcements would lag or sometimes announce movements that were no longer relevant This would disorient users leading to confusion about the items current position", "To solve this problem we added a small debounce to our move announcements We tested various debounce speeds with users and landed on ms to

we discovered that some of our users found it difficult to operate draganddrop with a keyboard Oftentimes draganddrop is not keyboard accessible or screen reader accessible As a result users with disabilities might not have had the opportunity to use draganddrop before making the operations unfamiliar to them", "This problem was particularly challenging to solve because we wanted to make sure our instruction set was easy to find but not a constant distraction for users who frequently use the draganddrop functionality", "To address this we added a dialog with a set of instructions that would open when a user activated draganddrop via the keyboard This dialog has a dont show this again checkbox preference for users who feel like they have a good grasp on the interaction and no longer want a reminder", "Challenge Moving items with voice control in a scrollable container", "One of the final big challenges we faced was operating draganddrop using voice control assistive technology We found that using", "to draganddrop items in a nonscrollable list was straightforward but when the list became scrollable it was nearly impossible to move an item from the top of the list to the bottom", " Voice control displays an overlay of numbers next to interactive items on the screen when requested These numbers are references to items a user can interact with For example if a user says Click item  and item  is a button on a web page the assistive technology will then click the button These number references dynamically update as the user scrolls through the webpage Because references are updated as a user scrolls scrolling the page while dragging an item via a numerical reference will cause the item to be dropped", "We found it critical to support two modes of operation in order to ensure that voice control users are able to sort items in a list The first mode of operation traditional draganddrop has been discussed previously The second mode is a move dialog", "The move dialog is a form that allows users to move items in a list without having to use traditional draganddrop", "The form includes two input fields action and position", "The action field specifies the movement or direction of the operation for example move item before or move item after And the position specifies the location of where the item should be moved", "Below the input fields we show a preview of where an item will be moved based on the input values This preview is announced using", "and provides a way for users to preview their movements before finalizing them", "During our testing we found that the move dialog was the preferred mode of operation for several of our users who do not use voice control assistive technology Our users felt more confident when using the move dialog to move items and we were delighted to find that our accessibility feature provided unexpected benefits to a wide range of users", "In Summary creating an accessible draganddrop pattern is challenging and it is important to leverage feedback and consider a diverse range of user needs If you are working to create an accessible draganddrop we hope our journey helps you understand the nuances and pitfalls of this complex pattern", "A big thanks to my colleagues", " for their hard work in making draganddrop more accessible Your dedication and expertise have been invaluable I am excited about

everything Integration SLAs are necessitiesand GitHub Premium Support makes sure that Sauerzapfs team is successful no matter when they work", "Sauerzapf also stressed the value of having a dedicated service account engineer someone deeply familiar not just with GitHub as a product but SAPs instance in particular to help manage and finetune it Sometimes there are things that need to be done inside GitHub that may be very minor but they make or break SAP and the experience of the developers in it Thats where the service account engineer is important With GitHub youre not only investing in software Youre also investing in an ecosystem of support And the value is clear", "With reliable tools that fit their needs SAP has created a flexible infrastructure that grows with the team

automobile from  hours to  minutes With this innovation in mass production Fords history became automotive history And the company kicked off a revolution in manufacturing how the product is produced is more ingenious than its individual parts", "Its not surprising that we often see todays cars as the result of artfully manufactured hardware but the industry has fundamentally changed over the last few decades Behind each part are complex software systemsnavigation interfaces pressure sensors customer service applicationswhich have steadily become the core of Fords business By leveraging technology and evolving with the pace of their industry Ford has earned a reputation as one of the countrys most trusted mobility companies Theyve transformed the way they build software to become a key player in the era of smart vehicles", "Many groups at Ford have been building software for decadesbut in that time each came up with its own solution Every group did something different said Florian Frischmuth Chief Engineer Architecture and Software Platform The status quo worked when there wasnt a need for groups to interact with each other he said As we expanded the development of more complex features we saw the need to work differently Thats when we discovered GitHub", "The teams evaluated a handful of solutions and GitHub came out on top Its strong following among new and experienced developers was also key Its taught in school said Carmean GitHub is the largest provider of open source repositories in the industry And people graduating from college know how to use it  which was one of the most important reasons we brought it in", "The widespread knowledge of GitHub among Ford engineers sped up adoption and ultimately reduced onboarding time to a few days Once they chose GitHub the team started small Fords first instance of GitHub Enterprise began in a lab but gained traction from there Carmeans original goal was to support  developers but their instance grew quickly and organically by word of mouth The company now has  employees on the platformand this number is only increasing", "At the time Ford started using GitHub it was developing a code base on a server underneath a professors desk It was somewhat of a Githosting platform said Carmean and it was critical intellectual property so we knew we had to get it out of there Carmean held weekly meetings with the CIO to provide GitHub status updates until its enterprise instance launched in September  Now weve got over  employees using it around the world including Germany England Turkey India China Australia Brazil Mexico and the United States", "Both Frischmuth and Carmean appreciate the benefits of one standardized tool set making a vast company all working on different systems

that no matter what software youre working on these tools are useful And GitHub is at the center driving everything", "When tasked with taking on a more agile workflow Ford engineers needed to evolve their workflows beyond the assemblyline system that originated in the manufacturing industry The way cars are built has fundamentally changedFords software processes needed to change too We had to work in a coherent and collaborative fashion as the product we created grew much more complex Frischmuth explained A car has hundreds of sensors Theyre not all connected but in order to create more features you need to build on these sensors You need to work together", "Make your repository public Then let people use it open pull requests and have conversations about it These features make the platform powerful", "As teams move further away from their outdated waterfall workflows Carmean prefers the Scaled Agile Framework SAFe Cars rolling off the assembly line have to be safe So we impose a greater level of discipline than many other industries By organizing around release trains the teams can ensure that the software features properly integrate and meet their thorough regulatory and safety requirements", "Innersourcinga way of building proprietary software that leverages and learns from open source best practicesis another method working inside Ford While it wasnt an original objective Carmean said When we started talking about code reuse we felt like we already had the perfect platform in place GitHub", "Tom Erickson Supervisor of Global Software Tools and Processes at Ford also encourages his group to use innersource methods and scrums to work together across teams They can make suggestions and adopt a style of working thats more open and fits their needs he said If you want to ship higher quality software faster innersourcing just makes sense", "With Fords code accessible to everyone in their organization teams are no longer separated by their organizational structures Instead they can work together on new code and make the most out of existing solutions Our environment allows developers to find solutions that have already been developed They can collaborate on those and then reuse them said Frischmuth", "This more open way of working has allowed developers the autonomy to follow through on new ideas enhancements fixes and more They no longer need permission to create a repository or offer up a suggestion removing bottlenecks across the organization If they do need more help Ford leans on GitHub professional services Erickson said Weve learned everything from how to scale our organization for real distributed repositories to how best to use Jenkins", "Were using GitHub for everything said Carmean including slide decks hosted among GitHub pages Other internal teams have also taken an interest in GitHub including engineering groups who conduct statistical analysis and put scripts in repositories IT support has one of the more unique use cases They make pretty comprehensive use of markdown in wikis to document how things are meant to work in the nextgen data center said Carmean He can simply drop an issue in the repository and get answers faster than with the older BMC ticket model", "Carmean understands the value of GitHub to both Ford and the larger open source community Make your repository public Then let people use it open pull requests and have conversations about it These features make the platform powerful", "GitHub also helps Ford find new talent Erickson said its something I look for on resumes and have our Human Resources Team look out for too Carmean added If youre doing anything open source youre doing it on GitHub To increase our talent pool we dig into the open source projects and the tools

value of embracing open source culture beyond our own contributionsour developers have connections to their own communities When others see who works here they might consider joining too", "Stripe develops the core of its product behind closed doors but engineers still apply a shared set of principles as they work on critical pieces of their product One of these principles innersource empowers any Stripe developer to get involved in any project and share their ideas and solutions This internal community removes friction as we build software while making all of our projects more open and

American Airlines annual developer competition HackWars would slowly fizzle out", "With GitHub as a requirement for participation in HackWars project visibility has increased and submissions are evolving into production solutions", "If youve booked a flight recently you can thank American Airlines for its innovation more than five decades ago In  during a time when clunky dialin reservations elicited an eight percent error rate a team of American and IBM programmers set out to build the first computerized transactionprocessing system It was an ambitious idea but the result drastically reduced mistakesand revolutized the way we make reservations and travel Today American is still championing groundbreaking ideas and using GitHub Enterprise as an incubator for inspiration", "With  flights per day to more than  destinations in  countries American is one of the biggest airlines in the world Of its  employees there are  employees dedicated to IT  percent of which are centrally located at Americans headquarters in Fort Worth with the remaining  percent stationed in Phoenix Tulsa London India and Argentina To kickstart secure innovation across borders and boundaries of all kinds American uses GitHub as part of HackWarsan annual internal event where the teams best ideas are born", "Since  HackWars has drawn  developers to Texas for a hour hackathon that focuses on developing products for American employees and customers Its essentially an accelerator for American and those who make it on to a team have bragging rights for the next year Its like a badge of honor because its oversold and we can only accommodate so many employees explained Spencer Kaiser Principal Architect of Emerging Tech This year it took us three minutes to hit our HackWars wait list", "The only problem was that every year many of these great ideas fizzled out because there was no ownership he explained That is until  when GitHub became a primary requirement for attendees We utilize GitHub as both a hosting and business engine solution that affords us a snapshot into the longterm vision for the ideas teams create he said With GitHub the team can rapidly view projects see which ones they should develop and take the necessary steps to put them on the path to becoming production applications", "Before GitHub teams were siloed They would choose their own tools on a projectbyproject basisbut it wasnt scalable American needed a solution that could break down the barriers to collaboration consolidate code and meet strict regulatory guidelines Now GitHub acts as a secure transitional tool after the event ends The team knows where everything is and we have all our code in one place said Kyle Lloyd Program Manager for Emerging Tech and Startups", "Today American has roughly  users who rely on GitHub as their fundamental listing platform for production applications group concepts everything Its our primary source for code listing and cloud storage said Kaiser It also helps that GitHub is what the majority of our developers are using he explained We want to give our team not just the tools that solve the problem but the ones they want to use And GitHub is the latest and greatest in this space", "From start to finish HackWars supports Americans three strategic objectives Make culture a competitive advantage create a worldclass customer experience and build American to thrive forever HackWars creates a culture of innovation that we want to keep fostering said Phillip Easter Head of Emerging Tech The more we do this the more employees engage and want to be on the creative side instead of slinging code all day It encourages any employeeno matter their levelto bring an idea forward for validation", "As HackWars approaches American uses GitHub to host important information and announcements Then  teams of  come together around a central theme In  for example the teams were tasked with forming storming and norming new apps for employees and customers with a focus on artificial intelligence drones and augmented and virtual reality", "GitHub keeps us up to speed with the industrys best tools We want new hires to know GitHub is in our toolchain it makes them excited to join us", "Teams are comprised of more than just developers You also see a mixture of project owners project managers business folks designers said Kaiser To validate ideas as theyre being developed they have  crossfunctional business unitsincluding airport operations customer experience and aircraft maintenancein what they call a business cantina to help avoid redundancies and mitigate missteps We dont want impractical ideas to get all the way to the end", "During the event American keeps all the HackWars projects in one place using the GitHub API to rapidly set things up give everyone access and even provide them with a GitHub Project with tasks designed to guide them through the event The template repository has a readme file that includes everything American expects from the teams and examples of how to structure a project We expect all those pieces to move and theres a component of scoring and completing those tasks said Kaiser", "Each years  sponsors arent just there for show Through GitHub topics American is able to digitally define which teams are leveraging what technology Sponsors simply run a slash command in slack to view all the different ways teams are using their products said Kaiser This is a vast improvement from the usual guesswork and encourages sponsors to continue working with American They absolutely love it and are thrilled to see such concrete results Stakeholders can pinpoint exactly whats popular and what worksand everyone gets to see how teams are applying technologies in new ways", "In order for HackWars to stay successful the team has to take action on the innovation it inspires One of the main motivators is to get cuttingedge software that impacts our customers explained Kaiser With GitHub we can quickly act on ideas iterate create proof of concepts and then fuel the fire Thats the true goal of HackWars", "Of the thousands of ideas that come from the event only eight teams make it to the finals three due to technical excellence and five because of their impactful idea Many are in production or have been allocated funding for development in  These include enhancements to employee travel tools for last minute travel opportunities an app that helps identify missrouted shipments for the cargo business line and an app to help make daytoday operations easier for frontline employees", "American Airlines has come a long way since  reimagining the employee and customer experience along the way and using GitHub to stay on the cutting edge When it comes to recruiting GitHub

commerce has grown to more than  billion people making purchases online annually As with any payment provider Opns top priority was the security of its customers confidential information credit card numbers account information and more But now the company is focused on diversifying its product line to meet the demands of the future and has expanded its offerings to include features like Opn Tag which creates customer digital touchpoints and services to expand its customers ecommerce offerings", "Opn not only provides its clientsincluding McDonalds Thailand Japanese drug store chain Tsuruha and insurance company Allianz Ayudhyawith the tools they need to connect with millions of potential customers and accept secure payments across multiple devices it also enables them to connect with those customers through custombuilt digital storefronts with online menus and ordering", "Opn first adopted GitHub in  to meet financial regulations Since Opn handles the data of branded credit cards including Visa Mastercard and JCB they must obtain and hold a Payment Card Industry PCI Standard This standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data and reduce potential fraud over multiple devices including phones tablets and computers In other words make sure credit card numbers dont end up in the wrong hands", "The PCI Standard prohibited Opn from hosting code on shared servers so the company chose to self host GitHub Enterprise enabling them to make pull requests and create issues boosting developer collaboration while keeping customer data secure GitHub Enterprise also helped Opn with the PCI audit process as it can operate on existing infrastructure with established information security controls allowing the team to determine the specific merge conditions necessary to stay compliant and make audits smoother", " Now entire workflows have been automated and security is embedded within the developer workflow", "Warachet Samtalee Senior Engineering Manager with the infrastructure team at Opn says that before Actions the company maintained and operated its own CI server but this often meant that the team was distracted with keeping the server running rather than focusing on the code With GitHub Actions we dont have to think about the hidden costs of maintaining the CICD servers The workflows are so smooth that the automation works as it should so developers can focus on communicating with customers and developing new innovations", "The team had previously tried other tools to automate processes but GitHub Actions is easy to use and developers can debug the workflows by themselves rather than relying on the infrastructure or DevOps teams explains Samtalee", "With GitHub Actions we dont have to think about the hidden costs of maintaining the CICD servers The workflows are so smooth that the automation works as it should so developers can focus on communicating with customers and developing new innovations", "Actions quickly became one of the most utilized tools at Opn Weve built an automated CICD workflow for any new professional services project Samtalee says For CI we offer testing and for CD we do some environment and workflow approval before deployment", "In addition to CICD Actions helps the team take security into their own hands For example Opn stores container images in AWS using OpenID Connect OIDC a keyless method that allows GitHub to connect with AWS using Actions instead of storing secrets in a GitHub repository", "When it came to selecting a security solution the choice to use GitHub Advanced Security was a nobrainer as GitHub was already a central component of Opns developer workflow says Samtalee Because our developers already use GitHub for their daytoday introducing security scanning as part of the usual workflow was seamless", "Now Opns developers find security vulnerabilities before they ever have a chance to reach production using both code scanning and features like Dependabot which examines supply chain vulnerabilities in dependencies With GitHub Advanced Security developers can help themselves says Samtalee They have the freedom to inherit the organizations security policy work and define their project policy standards and decide what level of code scanning they want directly in the repository based on the requirement from the project", "Because our developers already use GitHub

Japan and Europe A lot of developers already have a lot of experience with GitHub says Samtalee Everybody knows how it works New engineers can get up to speed in less than a day because the GitHub Enterprise virtual appliance includes all required software It makes onboarding a piece of cake", "Once hired employees from all corners of the world need to efficiently collaborate With GitHub engineers can easily work asynchronously You just change the code thats needed and get their approval Samtalee says Merge deploy done", "For Opn GitHub is exactly what they needed to meet strict

big piece of that growth and its shaped the company ever since Quickly Cesium saw their community grow on GitHub We got our first outside contributions Then we also had people on our forum answering other questions They were interacting with other people who werent developers said Amato Now the forum has over  posts in its history and the companys largest project", "Open source powers both their community and commercial success Built on top of the teams open source code Cesiums robust analytics and toolslike", "provide geospatial modeling and data visualizations With Cesium Stories users can upload geospatial data and D models Then Cesium ion a platform to create and host D content in the cloud will process the data in a way that is ideal for streaming or for use in geospatial

and other sources Cesium creates D virtual construction sites that reflect exactly whats happening on the ground and construction progress over time", "With such precise location services code quality and reliability are crucial GitHub integrates with the continuous integration CI tools Cesium already usesmaking it possible for Cesium to automatically perform quality tests and update environments This ensures that releases are always stable", "Were standardized on Travis CI for our continuous integration Almost every branch and every repository we have has Travis CIenabled explained Amato Originally the company made CesiumJS available on NPM After getting one million downloads they decided to transition their private packages to GitHub and keep opensource packages on NPM Cesium also uses", "extensively in production shared Shehzan Mohammed Director of Product Management By tying directly to our repositories GitHub Packages gives Cesium an automated secure path to continuous integration and deployment testing and delivering products to our customers and millions of open source users", "Along with streamlined automation GitHubs flexibility allows Cesium to deploy their platform frequently and perform updates as often as they see fit Weve done four or five deployments a day when things are moving along quickly said Amato This makes it easier to check out inprogress work across our ecosystem because we have several repositories that depend on each other If one team is working on a new feature that is one GitHub package we can easily use that package somewhere

then publishing directly", "Stable releases go beyond just good user experience As open source every release is an opportunity for Cesium to demonstrate the quality of their work to other companies Then when these companies want to develop an app or an endtoend solution Cesium is top of mind", "This same transparency extends to inside the organization as well Cesium uses GitHub as a repository for user guides and onboarding guides Beyond that the use of email is actually discouraged All documentation and internal communication can be found on GitHub", "As Cesium continues to find new applications for this technology their commitment to community is still at the forefront Were working on building and helping We want to make sure that were innovating in the right ways with what were

open source to the secrets of the worlds top maintainers And weve met some amazing peoplewhich means that while were away you should definitely check out any episodes youve missed", "But before you do that we of course have a whole lot of brand new content coming at you right now in this episode", "Yep Were going to speak with Ricardo Mirn Torres on the Digital Public Goods Alliance and senior editor Klint Finley is here to talk with us about PHP Laravel and what makes us a happy community", "And for Ask RMP we turn the tables a little bit and answer a question ourselves But first its First Commit", "Today well start in  In Great Britain the University of Cambridge to be specific the place was crawling with scientists droves of scientists working to make groundbreaking discoveries that would change the world And those scientists needed a lot of energy and inspiration What helps with that", "Chattering typing office background noise", "Well for me its a nice cup of tea but actually I think this one involves coffee doesnt it", "Yep You got that right", "You see the problem was all those scientists had to share a communal coffee pot", "Theyd be right in the middle of their experiments maybe pulling an allnighter and youre desperate you need that shot of caffeine So you walk all the way through the office you get there only to find the pot empty and slightly smelly Its so disappointing", "Thats the worst I dont experience that as much anymore because Im working from home but I DO have memories from being in the office and the coffee running out and its devastating When its done you have to tell people", "technological innovations before it necessityand maybe a little caffeine withdrawalwas the mother of invention This VERY FIRST WEBCAM was no different It was invented because people didnt want to walk down the hall if there wasnt coffee waiting for them", "And fun story when I was in college they had monitors for the laundry machine so that we didnt have to go all the way down only to figure out that the laundry machine was still occupied Best invention ever especially for a college dorm", "One of the goals Martin and I have had throughout this year is to really share with you all of the cool things that people are doing in the open source community around the world And one of those things we wanted to explore today is a community that has grown up around digital public goods which includes open source code open data open AI models Wikipedia and a lot more", "Yeah Our guest today is Ricardo Mirn Torres whos a technical coordinator and community manager for the Digital Public Goods Alliance Thats a UN initiative that was created to unlock the potential of open source to make a more equitable world There are more than  international member organizations including governments as well as GitHub and other private companies", "Were going to hear more about the equity gaps that the Alliance is aiming to close but first we wanted to hear a bit more about how Ricardo got involved", "So my background is in software development but I was pretty much involved on open source communities and I started to get a little bit more of the interest in civic tech which is mostly how we do technology to solve public problems And I work in a lot of different things around human rights around mobility around transparency of government stuff like that", "So when the opportunity came to join the alliance it was pretty much a straightforward for me a place to be to play a role in how the conversation of open source was relevant to solve some of these challenges And of course its a good place where not only civic tech but other things like digital identity like GovTech a lot of the things were hearing now with AI are also very relevant to this conversation And I think this is what led me to Alliance and helping shape this global stage for open source", "Wow Im a tactical person so now my interest is super piqued And Im really curious because you went over a few examples initially and you just covered this wide breadth of themes that DPGA covers but tactically how does the alliance determine what kinds of challenges to take on And do you have any examples of initiatives or projects that youre excited about", "As you know not all open source is made the same and when were trying to solve some of the worlds hardest challenges like climate change misinformation disaster relief and so on these digital solutions need to take into consideration not only putting the source code out there but also consider things like data privacy and security the use of open standards for interoperability the legal side of things as well like having a proper license copyright adherence laws and regulations and all of these kind of things", "And these solutions must be I think consciously designed to anticipate and prevent and do no harm by design So this is what we think digital public goods should be And actually the Alliance has created a DPG standard which is this set of criteria that help us define what characteristics should a DPG have And as you mentioned its not only for software but for data content AI standards and so on", "Maybe the first project I would like to talk about is open source digital healthcare information system that was created by the University of Oslo and its called DHIS  Its the backbone of digital healthcare in more than a hundred countries and serves almost a third of the worlds population So even depending of where you are hearing this your government or you might be using this software", "So I find very inspiring a story of one of these countries which is Sri Lanka a small country in the south of Asia that leveraged this open source platform DHIS  to create on top of it a COVID tracker And they were able to create and deploy this app in just a couple of days from which they detected their first case", "This allowed them to do contact tracing for COVID cases and they shared the source code of this app with the community just in a couple of months And thanks to the fact that it was based on this already wellused digital healthcare platform it was adopted by around another I think  countries and probably helped save thousands of lives And this is something that wouldnt have been possible at this scale if everyone was working on silos for example or with their own proprietary solutions stuff like that", "This level of scale and adoption was of course not a coincidence As I mentioned it was not just because the code was open but it was designed this way It was well documented it had the right license it was interoperable with the system and it was designed from the start to be a digital public good And as important as this is that it had this global stage as a DPG with a strong community of maintainers contributors implementers and more", "So no it is brilliant But with all this stuff thats happening obviously here at GitHub weve been trying to do a big push to make sure all this open source is available to everybody and that includes people with disabilities Is there any specific tools within the Digital Public Goods Alliance to help with accessibility of these public goods", "There are many things that we consider and some of these are more like we could say best practices and a lot of these best practices have to do of course with accessibility of the solutions in itself We have a couple for example theres one created in Argentina thats made to assist with learning of children that have deaf disabilities But there are several other examples I mentioned with children but also with refugees with elderly people and so on So this is definitely something that digital public goods take into consideration", "Thats really great to hear And obviously from the GitHub perspective one of the things that my mind goes to is its such a privilege to be able to give tools and opportunities to people openly and transparently And what comes with that is the fact that theres some maintenance work and theres someone behind the scenes that has to keep things up So I was curious from your side how do you ensure the longterm sustainability and maintenance with all of these digital public goods and how do you measure the impact of them", "So its really hard to actually measure the impact of an open source project in general mainly because by design its sometimes that way that you never know whos using that solution But of course sustainability is one of the key focus of the alliance And part of what we do is we provide this support through our member organizations We promote visibility of these resources which in itself increases the likelihood of continued support funding contributions and ensuring the availability and maintenance over time", "Its also a great work that the projects themselves carry on sometimes in ways they never could figure it out Theres this really interesting project called RapidPro which was developed I think even way back in  or six or something like that which was to start as a really small project with no real intention to kind of scale into what is right now", "And it got some funding from UNICEF to mainly be used to give assistance for organizations to use SMS services for not connected areas to facilitate communication between clinics and community health workers for food distribution and stuff like that But then it got used in so many other use cases that they probably have never imagined", "For example here in Mexico City where Im from they use RapidPro to alert and give notifications to citizens when we have earthquakes which happens quite often And I even personally worked on a project before joining the Alliance that used this open source tool to help guide families in Central America to report and search missing people and other human rights efforts", "So as part of this we got to contribute back to the project as well fix some bugs and improve overall the open source project which is in itself a digital public good So its a mix of the community actually using the project and contributing back as well as actual formal funding and support from organizations like UNICEF But there are many others that are helping us achieve these goals to promote digital public goods and keep sustainability of these projects", "One of the important things as well is while some of these systems are relied on in times of crisis thats also the worst time to be building them So as the community manager if people want to get involved now where things might be stable for them how should they get involved with your communities", "So there are a couple of ways that you can join these different communities One is directly through the open source projects that exist And for this we have the digital public goods registry which provides a single and easy accessible repository of all of these projects And it has information surrounding where its being developed where its being deployed organizations that support these solutions So if theres anything thats of your specific interest thats a way that you can directly identify and discover these kind of projects where you can contribute to", "But we also have some more formal community building initiatives that we have worked on For example last year we collaborated on Hacktoberfest to highlight some of these projects and for individual contributors to kind of participate in these activities", "Its also really good to hear that there are so many different ways to contribute and its not just the technical contributions So I feel like thats a really good sign of a healthy open source project Is there anything that you wish people knew or a common misconception", "On the digital public goods definition there are many views on whats a digital public good And the work we do and for example the standard I talk about is one of the ways that we help define through the organizations that are part of this Alliance create this common understanding of these kinds of projects But this doesnt necessarily mean that only the projects on the DPG Registry are the only digital public goods", "Were always trying to search for new projects new initiatives especially those that are not necessarily software This is an ongoing conversation in itself The DPG standard is an open project that anyone can contribute and help shape this definition and also help even nominate or promote some of these solutions So its not a super strict thing where everythings set in stone but rather that its an ongoing thing and something thats really on the works with many topics like AI also changing a little bit of the landscape of what we think of open source", "Yeah I like that Like a living and breathing definition", "Ricardo Mirn Torres technical coordinator and community manager for the Digital Public Goods Alliance thank you so much", "Thank you very much for inviting me and excited to see if some contributions come along to these digital public goods", "And to learn more about DPGA check out digitalpublicgoods dot net", "So Neha have you used PHP or Laravel at all", "Kind of My first job we were moving from Drupal off of Drupal and PHP onto a Java backend and moving things into middleware and backend and separating things out So I had a brief brush with it What about you", "So remember Im old and there was a time before Hotmail existed and Gmail and things and I wanted to access my email from work which was not allowed because like Port SMTP whatever and IMAP ports you couldnt access So obviously I built myself a web client for IMAP using PHP at the time it was that I just ran on my own little web server so I could access my email from work", "And to do that well be joined once again by The ReadME Project senior editor Klint Finley Hey Klint", "Hey So Neha and I chatted a bit about this already but why do some people kind of think that Laravel is their secret weapon", "Yeah well I mean like you said it just makes things really simple for people So I heard from Fathom Analytics CTO Jack Ellis that it just makes them really efficient They can write code very very quickly He says it saves them hundreds maybe even thousands of hours of development time", "And the reason for that is just so much is built into it already He was so enthused about it that he rebuilt their product from Go into PHP which just seems really counterintuitive Like Neha was saying they migrated from PHP to Java and thats sort of the expected move is that you would go from something like PHP a dynamic language like that over to a compiled language like Java or Go for the performance capabilities", "But what Jack Ellis was explaining was that they didnt really need that infrastructure level performance And if he did he wouldve stuck with Go or he would build it with Go But even for the hundreds of thousands of API calls that they process PHP was still more than adequate for that And they were able to work again just much more efficiently much more quickly using PHP than something that was less familiar to him like in this case Go", "And I think familiarity for sure and making sure that the language suits the basic needs that you have those are a few pieces of why someone would use it But there must be something different about Laravel and why someone would want to choose it over anything else So what are the unique features about it", "But even compared to Ruby Laravel has a lot of I guessm perks Queues is something that a lot of developers told me they were excited that is just built right into Laravel whereas you might have to pay for that as an addon feature in another platform Laravel does a lot to make deployment easy which is kind of a tradition I think in PHP is just the deployment story there is really appealing", "Yeah I think if it hadnt been for Facebook it felt like PHP wouldve died a long time ago And then things like Drupal as well seemed to be keeping them alive But when Laravel came and started becoming a lot more popular it definitely seemed to see a new resurgence And the community around Laravel in particular is just phenomenal isnt it Its a massive community out there", "And again just a community that isnt doing a lot of infighting all the time And I noticed I would talk to people who were would say I love Node but I wish JavaScript had a standard library or I remember the big fights over callbacks in Node I think or generics in Go a lot of issues with packaging in Python that are starting to finally be resolved Just all these little things that cause dissatisfaction or arguments and things like that", "Whereas in Laravel I mean its not always an apple to apples comparison because a framework and not a language but people were just really pleased with it and just really happy to be using what theyre using and not interested necessarily in jumping around and doing stack hopping which something else I tend to see a lot Theyre just really kind of in love with PHP I spoke with Mohamed Said about this and hes a former Laravel employee whos now the VP of infrastructure at the Dubai cloudbased restaurant software company Foodics", "If youre stuck with something like its very difficult for you to figure it out you can reach out to anyone in the community either in the core team or in the community itself and people are really helpful there And thats something like I havent seen in other communities something thats special about the Laravel community", "I think whats really interesting about what Mohamed said was that the community is a very important key aspect to someone being comfortable with a language And especially for a language thats as old as PHP its gotten the chance to learn a lot of the lessons through the different hype cycles as theyve come and gone and really hone in on what it wants to be good at", "And as someone who over time I have to make so many decisions on a daytoday basis having a language that really intimately understands which ones I want to have autonomy over and which ones it wants to take that away from me and just make it easy and make it happen Theres something really special to go back to those basics and see those old languages that have survived this long and how theyve evolved and are serving our needs today", "Yeah So I mean Klint why do you think if people havent looked at PHP in a while and if people havent really played with Laravel why does this matter to them Why is this important", "If you already know PHP then definitely give Laravel a look Especially if you havent looked at PHP in a long time You might be pleasantly surprised But I mean even developers who are only aware of Laravels strengths can benefit Maybe learn some lessons from how it works Heres what Mohamed had to say about that", "The most important thing is that an open source contributor or an open source maintainer needs to think about building something for the people not the code itself So a lot of people get stuck into thinking that Im going to write the perfect open source tool Im going to provide the perfect code and everything but they forget about writing good documentation They forget about showcasing how their tool works what problems it does solve", "So thats something that Laravel does differently It focuses on the use cases first and puts a lot of effort into the documentation And even though the code is really good and its well organized and performance is important but Taylor focuses more on writing code for the people more than for the machines So I think thats something that other open source contributors can learn from", "I love that peoplecentric view Klint thanks so much And before you go can you let us know whats coming up on The ReadME Project", "Sure This month Anton Mirhorodchenko shares his story of learning to program as a developer with cerebral palsy and how he uses GitHub Copilot and other AI tools to accomplish more than he could before Then we have a guide by Drupal contributor Mike Gifford on what you can Learn from Drupals accessibility journey", "We also have Niek Palms guide to using the open source selfhosted GitHub Actions Runner created by Philips And finally as you noted at the top of the show The ReadME Project is taking a little break Were doing that in part because were going to be developing new content and formats and newways to serve you as an audience Tell us what you loved what youd like to see and what we could do differently Send us an email at", "But Martin Neha before I go and while I still have the mic Im thinking this is my chance to do something Ive been holding back on all season Turn the tables and focus on the two of you for this months Ask RMP Id love to know whats the coolest thing you experienced or your most memorable moment of the season", "Oh without doubt my favorite moment was talking with Professor Annalu Waller That episode was just amazing for me just learning all about the work that she did and just the pride that she had in her student It was just wonderful to see And probably seeing you meltdown as well Neha That was a good one in a different episode", "Oh yeah that was going to be my one and also the interview with Kelsey Hightower where I absolutely just broke into shambles during his response to the question around one of his most memorable moments speaking at a conference and hearing him talk about representation and the value of it I dont think Ive been the same since that episode and it was exactly what I needed to hear It was absolutely wonderful Definitely most memorable moment was that and then choking through the ending of that and trying to say thank you while being in tears", "Like any narcissist I listen to the show and so I was listening through to the show later and listened to that part of the episode and I was blubbing in tears thinking about your reaction while out for a walk in the countryside So there we go", "The ReadME Podcast is a GitHub production A huge thank you to our hosts Martin Woodward and Neha Batra for

Developer Relations Team", "And Im Neha Batra from GitHubs Core Productivity Team And this is a very special episode were bringing you to celebrate Maintainers Month in the month of Mayor dare I say Maytainers month Anyway Im going to get straight to it with great insights from someone we all look up to in the space", "Indeed our guest is probably most well known for his work on Kubernetes the incredibly popular open sourced container orchestration platform and ecosystem really I guess And in his spare time he does a lot of work encouraging people to get into open source and kind of building their careers in computing Hes also one of the kindest and nicest people youre ever going to meet in tech", "If you havent guessed by now were joined by legendary software engineer and developer advocate Kelsey Hightower Hey Kelsey", "Im doing pretty good Im really excited to have you here And were going to get to some nitty gritty maintainer stuff in a bit But I just wanted to start by hearing a bit more about how you approach growth and development Like whats your philosophy in the space and is it about being selftaught and just trying stuff out", "Yeah I mean we were quite lucky in some ways growing up in kind of the late s and early noughties because you could go to the bookstore and learn a bit I sometimes Im just amazed by you know folks coming out of bootcamps and folks coming into tech now because of just the breadth of technology that they have to know And yet if I only had to know a little bit at a time", "So how do you approach you know developing your skills now Because it never stops does it What are your signs when something is worthwhile investigating or how do you prioritize your time and energy", "So I think theres like a moment where if you have only one weekfive days of workyou take one of those days and you just put a big block in your calendar called learning Theres a lot of value in just pushing back from the keyboard and saying Let me make sure I understand these fundamentals", "The thing is they didnt have all the insight They didnt know that there was a back channel conversation where I decided that no was the right answer for Confd and yes was the right answer for console template And I celebrated Mitchell Hashimoto in the HashiCorp team for taking the idea of Confd and allowing it to live on in this way that satisfies their community Takes pressure off of me and it gives the community what they want And thats the power of open source that we can actually collaborate even when were competing", "Yeah if youre a maintainer we always think about the technical roadmap Whats in the next release Where should this project be two years from now But we dont think about the subroadmap that hidden roadmap Who is going to be maintaining this two years from now and it may not be you And I think one of the things we should think about early is what is the succession plan", "Also as a developer it is our one clean canvas to build whatever we want right Theres no OKRs theres no company pressure", "Yeah Yeah Hey listen we cant have a conversation with you without touching on Kubernetes You know I know youve been focusing on the human side a lot but youve been involved kind of since inception of it really How have you seen it evolve How have you seen the community change and kind of you know what do you think the future is around Kubernetes", "So I think Kubernetes API model its plugin model was like a gift to all future maintainers Because now that group of people dont need to try to figure out how to add every bell and whistle to Kubernetes The API allows you to do it yourself and the best ones will actually grow their own sub communities that satellite in the orbit of Kubernetes", "Theres probably a lot of successful initiatives but weve got to remember a lot of people in other groups get to also make a choice Theres lots of conferences to go to Theres lots of projects to work on And were really asking them to spend their time and parts of their life with us And if thats not welcoming no one in their right mind is going to choose to go to a place where they have to fight to be there just doesnt make sense", "And when you think about what it takes to build a gate you cant build a gate unless you have like a strategic positioning right The land needs to be narrow enough where the gate can cover both ends to keep people out and you guard the gate But open source just feels like an open range There is no gate you can build long enough for open source because anyone can start a project anyone can contribute to a project And so I felt like open source was so inviting", "Awesome Thanks for having me Yep", "Thanks so much again to Kelsey Hightower for that amazing conversation Hes always just so thoughtful and kind", "And before we go I loved that Kelsey mentioned the support that can be found in the open source community especially among maintainers To celebrate that camaraderie we asked a few other maintainers if they wanted to give a shoutout to someone THEYd like to thank You should hopefully recognise a few familiar voices for those who have been around The ReadME Project for a while To everyone who maintains an open source project thanks from everyone here", "My name is Aaron Francis I am the maintainer of Sidecar for Laravel But more importantly I want

I got a minor in web design which didnt provide me with many of the DevOps automation and network engineering skills Ive developed since graduating That was mostly selftaught and it wasnt always a smooth ride I would spend time on Stack Exchange looking for help and instead of finding guidance The top answers were usually Why would you even try to do it this way Theres a lot of gatekeeping which can make it challenging to feel like you belong", "Struggling through without the right background or resources often felt like a lonely battle But I came to understand that there are many others like me grappling with the same hurdles and in danger of being pushed out of the field Thats why I started my blog series ", " why I run a YouTube", " and why I give conference talks I wanted people to see that they can do it too All you need is someone whos willing to help and that can change everything", "Its all about being patient taking things slow and reminding people its okay to mess up Ive seen a lot of smart people in this field who are more interested in showing off than helping out Thats not me I want to be the person who helps the person who encourages and guides others Because without help along the way I wouldve just thought I was too dumband no one deserves to feel that way", "It wasnt until college that I realized not everyone finds fixing computers as intuitive as I did Realizing I could make a career out of this was empowering because to me it just felt like having fun", "Finding allies in unexpected places", "Several years ago I was interviewing for a job with a company that was looking for a staff security engineer for their cloud services team The role required a high degree of technical proficiency and acute attention to security The hiring panel was intimidating filled with technical experts which had me thinking Im not as smart as you all are But I was confident about my ability to do the job and more importantly to teach others", "To my surprise when I brought up my talent for education it was dismissed as inconsequential Thats not a skill set thats useful they told me discounting my ability to distill complex information into digestible knowledge for others It was then that a member of the panel a woman named Devina stepped in to defend my perspective Hold up a minute she said Youre describing me Thats what I do here Youre saying what I do is not valuable", "A few days later Devina called me out of the blue She had been let go from the company The same abilities theyd belittled in me were ones they decided were useless in her role But Devina didnt let that incident shatter her spirit She started a nonprofit focused on teaching tech to underrepresented groups especially women Her initiative struck a chord with me We were after all bound by the same mission to make tech accessible to all", "That interview didnt result in a job offer but it did lead to a valuable friendship with Devina and a reinforced belief in our shared vision To this day we continue to work towards removing the educational barriers for those eager to enter the tech world focusing on the underrepresented groups often overlooked by traditional avenues Its a journey thats far from over but its one we are committed to seeing through together", "To this day we continue to work towards removing the educational barriers for those eager to enter the tech world focusing on the underrepresented groups often overlooked by traditional avenues", "A change in identity and perspective", "I came out as trans just a few years ago midcareer and fully aware of how I was treated as a man People would listen when I spoke my ideas were valued and there was a tacit belief in my competence But posttransition that belief was replaced by skepticism and condescension making me feel the need for male endorsement to have my ideas heard and my capabilities respected", "My mission now is to ensure that the next generation has an easier path Rather than perpetuate the gatekeeping I experienced in some forums early on I hope to open the doors of learning for others helping them climb the ladder of their careers and ensuring they can stay true to themselves While part of this drive is fueled by my desire for financial freedom and independence a large part of it is rooted in my desire to help others just as I was helped along my journey", "In the end my experiences and struggles have shaped me into who I am today Theyve taught me that being true to oneself while it comes with challenges also brings an unmatched sense of achievement And in my book thats a win not just for me but for everyone who learns from my journey", "I hope to open the doors of learning for others helping them climb the ladder of their careers and ensuring they can stay true to themselves", "Throughout my journey from a farm in Nebraska to the hightech industry the importance of inclusivity learning and community has remained a constant With every computer I fixed every blog post I wrote and every cloud computing lesson I conducted my goal was to create an environment of learning and inclusivity As an oddball kid fixing computers for treats or as a tech educator empowering underrepresented groups my drive has always been to educate and bring people together Ive seen the value of a patient guide whos willing to help because without that I wouldnt be here today", "This journey has taught me that if you can understand the basics you can achieve anything All the seemingly complex technology like Kubernetes and CICD automation can be broken down into basic components This is why I see myself primarily as a teacherits a role that informs my writing educating and engineering Its a role that reminds me that we all start from the

more efficiently and is especially helpful in technical fields such as science medicine and programming", "Remember as we explained above that every word in your input prompt counts and increases both the complexity of the task and potentially the inaccuracy of the response Keeping your prompt brief can mean removing language you would use to communicate with a person that only adds confusion for an LLM For example skip the Can you at the beginning of the sentence and get straight to the query Every word counts and an LLM is less concerned with proper grammar than the relationship between the

whereas ", " may imply a more thorough investigation into the root cause of the issue before taking action As such you need to carefully choose every word", "Keep the conversation focused on a single task as much as possible and dont hesitate to create as many dialogues as you need Just like conversing with humans you shouldnt mix different topics tasks or levels of responsibility such as junior and senior developer roles in a single dialogue because it can become confusing", "For example if you want to ask an LLM to fix a bug dont ask it to do it in the same dialogue as where you ask it to investigate the bug Here we can combine some of the tips described above and instead use a dialogue where youve assigned a senior developer role to investigate the bug and provide a list of tasks for junior developers Then in a separate dialogue where youve assigned the LLM a junior developer role you can input that list requesting the actions the junior developer would take to fix the bug", "You might be tempted to treat each of these dialogues as a continued conversation but remember that more context can actually mean more complexity and therefore inaccuracy Instead keep just the initial prompt assigning the role and then edit your subsequent prompt with the input to keep the context small and focused This allows you to work on the next task without polluting the context of a previous and potentially very different task", "Lastly interrupt response generation to load the LLM with context For example provide a project description and then immediately interrupt the response generation so it doesnt complete Then enter the task as the next input By doing this you provide the LLM with context as a separate message but you dont allow the LLM to pollute its own context with

more egalitarian societies where outcomes for the least advantaged were still positive This parallels the progressive enhancement design philosophy which prioritizes universal access to essential tasks ensuring every user can navigate and interact with the internet effectively regardless of their unique circumstances", "Progressive enhancement begins with constructing a robust and universally accessible foundation designed to cater to all users regardless of individual or technological circumstances From here advanced features can be strategically layered to enhance the user experience wherever feasible Even as these enhancements roll out guided by the capacities of different devices the quality of network connections or the availability of specific APIs the core functionalities

dependencies like CSS and JavaScript dont load apply or run as wed hope in an ideal environment It then layers on HTML semantics to form a document outline enhancing the experience for screen readers and providing basic visual structure through browser default styles Next come forms for interactivity and cascading style sheets CSS for advanced layout color and stylistic options Even within CSS constructs like supports allow granular testing for property or selector support enabling further enhancements", "A fundamental principle of progressive enhancement is the concept of faulttolerance which can be seen in CSSs ability to allow us to define the same property multiple times In instances like the use of newer features such as P colors older browsers that dont recognize these will revert to a value they comprehend Thus even within a single language like CSS were progressively enhancing the user experience This layered approach is critical to building a more inclusive fair and

that helps you keep on delivering", "Kunckova meanwhile points to kindness as the key ingredient in what makes Laravel successful The community is what it is because people actively try to make it

to do with Laravel but with PHPs reputation", "Laravel is still growing in popularity at least as measured by downloads and conference attendance That might be mostly because existing PHP developers

divorced from the code that the developers are working on So often the discussion around how to address these errors boils down to how to conform with legislation like Section  in the US or the Web Accessibility Directive in Europe and nothing more", "In a complex application it can seem like accessibility errors are a neverending list of problems Attempts to fix them are often shortlived and new barriers keep popping up leaving teams feeling like theyre playing accessibility whackamole This tends to be disempowering for the millions of teams developing on GitHub but even more so for the IT community who depends on those libraries", " the popular open source content management system takes a different approach to removing accessibility barriers and has been a leader in digital accessibility for over a decade now Teams in government and education often use Drupal in part because it helps them achieve their own accessibility requirements As a Drupal Core Accessibility

Drupal founder and lead developer", "and the leadership team have clearly prioritized accessibility They made it obvious early on that accessibility issues needed to be addressed and treated as bugs not feature requests Without that clarity it is unlikely there would have been much progress on digital inclusion", "Everyone thinks accessibility is a good thing but not many are willing to delay a major software release for it Drupal signaled its commitment when it made accessibility a", " which has meant monthslong delays for Drupal releases because of accessibility issues People pay attention when this happens Its easy to claim that issues will be fixed after the release but it takes the support of leadership to hold it back", "contributes considerably to Drupal Core and he has hired a number of key staff to work on accessibility issues over the years helping to fix them early in the development process If accessibility issues arent addressed while new features are being developed theyll be less likely to be successfully addressed in the future when theyre inevitably more fragile and more expensive to implement", "As a result of leaderships example the Drupal community cares about accessibility This is evident in both our online community and conferences We invested in accessibility before it became popular Our success made it a higher priority for leadership to fully embrace Making it easier for a diverse range of people to participate allows everyone to learn and grow", "I do think it also helps to have tenacious accessibility leadership The Drupal community has had a number of Core Accessibility Maintainers and all of them have provided leadership As the longeststanding maintainer I can say quite confidently that so much of what I have learned about accessibility I learned by engaging with both the Drupal and accessibility communities", "Understand where you are on the accessibility spectrum", "When I committed to improving Drupals accessibility in  I thought that it would be a fairly simple problem to solve Drupal was already committed to open standards as governments around the world were using it It leverages reusable templates which limits the number of places that accessibility issues that arise making them relatively easy to track down and resolve Furthermore complex web forms are managed through a central forms API again eliminating the need to hunt down random form errors throughout the code", "Nowadays it might seem like Drupal is less accessible because there are far more known accessibility issues than there were back in  but thats only because weve gotten better at identifying them In reality Drupal is substantially more accessible", "When assessing a projects accessibility I often search the issue queue on GitHub for accessibility It isnt uncommon to find a couple issues and some projects use GitHub tags to help track them But while these open issues indicate that a project might be aware of its own accessibility barriers its not sufficient to understand the maturity of its approach to accessibility", "Once Ive viewed the reported accessibility errors in the issue queue I will often try to look at the user interface If a project has a demo I can easily evaluate it with Microsofts open source", " It can provide a summary of errors that make it easy to replicate Replication is key to resolving any software bugs I can then add this to the projects issue queue for the maintainers to consider Reporting these errors is just the first step Developers need to replicate the identified bugs and resolve them", "An additional challenge for project maintainers is that they often get a single issue with a bunch of unrelated accessibility problems all grouped together Its much easier to tackle separate issues bundled by error type It provides a much more granular and actionable view You may need to ask the people reporting the issue to create child issues and break them down into pieces that are easier for your team to implement", "Another issue you might face is having too many accessibility problems to solve right away The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG cover a wide range of accessibility issues The WCAG offer a map of best practices but your users may face a range of barriersnot all of which will have clear solutions to implement If this is the case for your project the first step is to orient yourself about what is possible Progress over perfection but remember that you should be able to prove that youre making progress", "Accessibility for all users not just end users", "By Drupal  we became one of the first publishing tools to implement the WCs", "Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines ATAG ", " which it released in  ATAG is often overlooked but

practically all of us will have temporary or situational disabilities This includes our authors so they cannot be overlooked", "Second ATAG helps authors create more accessible content This is huge

defaults that encourage accessibility best practices", "When to use existing accessibility best practices vs when to build your own", "In many cases accessibility best practices have already been welldefined Often its just a matter of finding an example thats already been published and tested There are so many terrific libraries out there to build on that have demonstrated which semantic patterns work best with current browsers and assistive technologies", "However identifying and testing best practices is timeconsuming Unfortunately we cant always find solutions that work In these cases its necessary to create new solutions", "For example when we realized that hidden text was a problem for assistive technology we developed a strategy for content that was hidden visible on focus and visible only to screen readers Later when the HTML  Boiler Plate popularized a similar approach we aligned with that standard", "Were also still looking to improve the ways we present error messages to assistive technology users Web forms are particularly challenging as they often have accessibility issues even before you have to account for errors", "This is where the open source community can help Innovations can jump between projects quite quickly Are there examples of code which have been developed and tested by other open source communities you can use", "Accessibility must be seen as a journey We have dramatically improved the accessibility of Drupal but there is still room to improve Fortunately because Drupal is open source others will be able to build on our work and further raise the bar on inclusion", "Accessibility is a spectrum Start where you are", "The most important thing in your inclusion journey is to start where you are There are so many things to learn and different ways that you can become a better developer One way is to invest in learning more about semantic HTML which can convey more meaning for assistive technologies than CSS markup You will not only benefit it will benefit the people around you and the future software you build", "The time to begin is now There is no shortage of free tools and resources that you can leverageincluding Drupal Examples of open source communities who have dramatically improved their accessibility abound Most importantly if your project is being actively developed it is easier to fix accessibility issues today than it will be in six months", "If you value accessibility but arent sure where to begin consider starting with Drupal It may not meet all of your requirements but we have spent more than a decade finding ways to improve our accessibility No matter what framework you end up using for your final project there will be good practices to emulate", "You might be looking at your project and seeing a mountain of work to make it accessible This is alright and is perhaps to be expected To this day Drupal still has hundreds of issues outstanding in the issue queue and many thorny challenges yet to tackle But were always improving and so can you", "Remember that you are on a journey and be comfortable knowing that there will always be opportunities for improvement There is a great deal to learn about digital accessibility but there are so many open source resources that you can learn from and contribute to Every maintainer contributor and organization can help move

available for open source projects We chose GitHub as our standard tool for software development due to its versatility and support for", "collaboration However to support different operating systems and architectures and connect to our internal network we needed selfhosted runners", "To address this we built a cloudbased solution that automatically scales up and down based on workload Compared to maintaining physical servers this approach proved both costeffective and sustainable The solution is", "and easy to deploy using Terraform and GitHub Actions for automation", "While we faced some challenges during scaling the benefits of selfhosted runners in the cloud far outweighed them If you need control over your network hardware or software selfhosted runners are a great choice However for simpler workflows hosted runners might be more practical In the end our developers found the solution seamless allowing them to focus on coding rather than worrying about infrastructure", "In this video Guide you will learn", "How Philips software development process operates and why control over systems is crucial", "How selfhosted runners along with GitHub Actions helped to transform and streamline our processes", "How to create scalable cloudbased solutions that can efficiently manage resources and control costs", "Provisioning selfhosted GitHub Actions Runners ondemand", "Hi my name is Niek Palm I work for Philips as principal engineer in the software Center of excellence there improving the life of our developers by giving them better tools to work faster together", "One of the things we introduced over the last year was GitHub with GitHub Actions To be able to use GitHub Actions we have the need of selfhosted runners Today I will explain to you how we make the selfhosted runners working for our company on demand at scale", "Philips a company that is already older than inaudible years made a lot of things over the last years And maybe you know the company from the lights television or maybe even air fryer But the companys changed over the last year Weve become a health tech company a company building health technology to improve the life of people And an important part of that technology is of course software", "So that brings me to the last point here is we built already quite a lot of code We are not new here in this field We do this already for  years So we have whole lot of names lines of code theyre sitting in all kind of code systems and it makes it hard working together And this is what we are changing Thats the reason why we choose GitHub", "So GitHub is today our standard tool for doing software development And we are moving a lot of code out of our legacy systems to GitHub And we do that in a model that we call InnerSource Huh InnerSource is something like open source but open source is out in the public and InnerSource is safe inside the boundaries of your company a way how you can work together", "When you do software development of course I think we all know that we need CICD and everyones choosing GitHub Actions to build test and deploy our software", "So GitHub Actions is a nice way of doing your CICD and maybe important to notice here is that you can do much more with GitHub Actions You can automate anything in the GitHub ecosystem", "And in the model of selfhosted runners you run the GitHub agent somewhere on your systems or in our case many selfhosted runners somewhere on our systems And now of all the good reasons to choose selfhosted runners it could be that you want to choose your own hardware you want to define something for GPUs or define software or have in general you could say if you have any kind of level that you need some control there for whatever it iscalls or security hardware softwareselfhosted runners is maybe the way to go", "So we choose selfhosted runners And then we start thinking okay how can we make that easy for our developers Can we make it as simple as they used to get the hosted runner So forget the hosted runner The only thing that developers have to do is define tech in the workflow or label as it is called", "And then the job will run somewhere on the GitHubhosted runner and its free for open source And if you are if you have private repositories or internal ones then you pay of course for it You can also use selfhosted runners and then you define and label something like selfhosted runners but then you have to have a runner somewhere for yourself", "Should your developers spin up all those kind of notices and manage their own hardware Or can we make it easy for them Can we make it as easy as using hosted runners So they come automatically", "So a way to do that is of course buy a lot of computers and install all the runners And if you buy enough computers you can certainly reach a big scale but its not scalable Its not scaling automatically up and down and certainly not sustainable", "So most likely all those computers are running all the time And its not sustainable and you waste a lot of energy And today with energy prices rising its also a very expensive operation And I think I dont have to explain that doing an operation like this is maintenancewise a big hell", "But today we can use the cloud So what we did here is we built a cloudbased solution to scale the selfhosted runners up and down And in our case that is on Amazon So our cloudbased solution is on Amazon And at the moment we get a job we get an event for a job we scale up and theres no workload to process We scale down That gives us a scalable solution We utilize the elasticity of the cloud and it also gives a sustainable solution because we only have computers running at the moment we need it", "So with this solution that you can define yourself for Amazon Cloud you get control over network software hardware and also your cost And this solution that weve built is out there open source its on GitHub", "So at the moment theres nothing to do It scales them down It removes instances from the kettle So the solution is scaling up and down and therefore sustainable", "For the the fertile machines where the selfhosted runners are running you can choose Amazon on the month instances or even be cheaper with spot instances So then you have really the lowest price that you can pay for running your CICD jobs", "And doing that from scratch I would say that this is  minutes or so so its even not hard And if the solution deployed you can run the operation for one repository  repositories all those repositories in our case for thousands of repos and thousands of jobs And that works nicely", "And in Philips we use it today we actually used it already for two years and it becomes very simple for developers They are not aware anymore that there is something like runners that needs to run somewhere The only thing they have to do is define the label the label that you see in the workflow with the Philips label and then the system starts scaling up and down during the week", "That bring me by my final question Should I use selfhosted runners or hosted runners Its something that I cannot answer for you eh Its something that you have to answer yourself", "If you dont need all those kind of controls I guess it is much simpler to stick to hosted runners Everything is managed for you and theres nothing where you have to take care about", "Thank you for attending the session today I hope you learned how you can use GitHub selfhosted runners on demand at scale Everything Ive shown today is open source and it is mentioned on the GitHub documentation page Go out to our repository submit an issue make a PR make the community even more happy than they are today or reach out to me in person Thank you Thank you very much Have a

around the community On GitHub Im Neha Batra and I lead GitHubs core productivity team", "And Im Martin Woodward from the GitHub developer relations team Hey Neha theres a phrase that Mark Andreessen made famous Software is eating the world Have you heard of that", "Well Ive been thinking a bit about this recently We can put a whole new spin on it Open source is also eating the world", "Okay aggressive But explain that to me What do you mean by that", "Well Ive just been thinking theres so many ways that what we do what the GitHub community does its not just building websites building the libraries for other developers whatever everything we do impacts everybodys lives on the planet Theres nobody that it doesnt touch", "Yeah I mean if I think about it I know theres an impact in pharmaceuticals and in farming and in so many things So in a way you can say that relying on software", "Right So thats what I was thinking I thought we could have a look at some of the hidden ways that open source and software in general is changing our lives", "And along those lines I think there are a lot of ways that the less technical less codey parts of our jobs get overlooked but theyre also super important So its a bit of the flip side right Devs are influencing everything but they also depend on solid communication good writing and a lot of other skills that make a symbiotic relationship", "Yeah exactly Which means on the show today weve got ", "Actually yeah wait Martin Ive been meaning to tell you I hate to do this but Ive got to hit the road this month Ive got family travel conference travel You know how it is The good news is I get to do something that I know you love to do too Im meeting more devs from the GitHub community but hey youre going to do great I cant wait to listen", "So Im Im just doing these on my own", "Throughout the show today well be looking at a lot of ways that open source feeds into a lot of things and the key word here is feed It isnt hard to think about those massive industrial farms with huge irrigation systems automated machinery theyre all using open source right But what if I told you people were also using this kind of technology in their own garden variety gardens Enter FarmBot", " I love to grow artisanal vegetables", " Its a system that offers hardware and software to create your own smart garden in your backyard Its run a hundred percent on open source Its not only more ecofriendly than buying all your produce at the grocery store It lets you customize your garden as youd like There are motors seeders and other handy things to help you grow all the plants you want", "Plus everything youd expect for an open source community like documentation resources to build plugins the ability to make contributions to all the open source repositories all that meaty stuff or not so meaty I guess vegetabley I dont know Anyway its pretty cool that something like this can bring together technologists and traditionalists Maybe they can even get together and break bread or maybe a nice carrot cake or something", "But be forewarned its all open source So if your setup doesnt work quite right or youre not loving how your radishes have turned out get ready to head to the FarmBot Community forum for help", "As we know from the kind of behind the scenes work that a lot of us do developers and open source have a hand in all different aspects of life that many many people dont actually realize Its one of my things I really love about my job actually Its not just the code part but the human parts that we have impacts on", "Thank you so much Im thrilled to be here", "So first do you want to tell us a bit more about what you actually do at Veradigm", "Earlier in the show we were talking about farming and you actually worked on a farm back in the day right Before you got into tech", "I did I grew up in a very rural Nebraska in the center of the United States and you dont apply theres theres no interview Youre just the child of a farmer and you go to work because you live there and if you want to keep eating in my house And it was just a ton of fun to grow up on a farm in wide open spaces and drive tractors and play with dangerous equipment but there was no air conditioning So here at computers I am", "Well I live in the middle of rural northern Island surrounded by farmland with no air conditioning So I certainly know how that is How do you think the experience shaped the way you do what you do now Seems very very different working in healthcare to working in farming", "And its very much the same as growing up very rural or trying to solve problems out in the country because you are very limited in the toolbox that you have I love the open source communitys contributions because many of those tools I can use because I can audit the code base I can use those things So those open source tools are incredible for getting me started because they were low cost and building really cool stuff these days because Im able to use them in regulated industries by and large", "And thats something that I think people who havent worked in say healthcare or maybe some of the legal side as well People in banks think they have regulation to deal with but in healthcare its a whole different ball game Its a very very regulated industry for good reasons When I have a bad day people cant compile code or people cant push code or something like that thats a bad day for me But when you have a bad day theres like lives and peoples privacy on the line", "Absolutely I contracted for a while as a network engineer That was my upbringing in the IT world before I get entered DevOps and cloud And I was talking to one of the doctors on the floor of a hospital I was supporting and he was telling me well all the crash carts that revive people from death are Wifidriven So make sure the wifi stays up when you do that upgradelike lives literally depend on it And that kind of pressure is something I have never forgotten", "So what are the biggest challenges you actually see in the healthcare space Is it around security and locking things down or what is it Whats the most problematic things that youre seeing right now", "The answer is yes among many organizations many many industries The problem is you have to be totally secure and you also have to be totally fluid and allow your developers to innovate and experiment and test You legally have to remain secure but in industry in competition in free markets youre required to compete quite strongly by innovation rapidlyso you have to do both and thats an impossible challenge Its one that we do our best to solve but its a very difficult challenge to solve", "So how do you actually go about providing those guardrails so that developers and teams can innovate but have the safety net so that they can do this in a secure way but also do it in a way that they have psychological safety as well because nobody wants to leak patient data accidentally So how do you go about putting those guardrails in place for teams", "Well you mentioned cloud I mean and you are an AWS builder as well So cloud and healthcare thats kind of healthcare was some of the sort of slowest people to move to cloud because of all that regulation and cause of all the challenges that exist in moving to sort of a cloud way of working", "So what challenges and opportunities do you think you should flag for people who are you know their companies kind of still getting into cloud or getting better at doing cloud software in different environments", "And that draw in terms of being competitive in an open market is huge It cant be overstated because it is everything So theres been a ton of pressure on cloud providers to please secure your things use secure defaults I understand it lets people move faster to turn off security but really we need it And even governments these days theres a gov cloud for AWS are coming around Even military secrets are now being put in clouds into public clouds", "So I think were there I think we are It takes some special training it takes some understanding of maybe the weak points S buckets have always been just overly complicated and leaking data sometimes So you just have to know how to secure those Anything that touches the internet should be carefully considered and architected But things that are internal and dont touch the internet you can feel free to experiment and build and break anything you need", "But eventually I got there And thats just something that someone will need to fight within your own organization that cultural fight with legal and risk and compliance that youre not going to compromise your environment", "Well and I guess thats one of the ways in which kind of public clouds but also open source helps because by ripping out the proprietary stuff and focusing it on the public cloud endpoints youre using or the terraform kind of scripts you are using to actually do deployments of things it kind of makes it more reusable to people anyway and more applicable to their daytoday", "When you first start out in tech you think oh when Im a real programmer Ill write everything novel everything will be bespoke and all Itll come out of my I copy stuff from Stack Exchange about  times a day and I guarantee you all your seniors do too So go and copy code go and try to understand what people are doing And now that we have tools like Terraform you can copy infrastructure configurations too and plop them down in your environments for testing", "Now were seeing kind of a massive rise in people doing network engineering some of the more like the GitOps movement as well to a certain extent coming into open source and sharing their stuff in the open a lot more now Any last bits of advice for somebody like you thats come from more of a networking space getting into DevOps getting into the cloud where should people start and what should people go do You must get asked this question all the time at conferences and things", "Well hey Kyler Middleton thank you very much for your time Its been a pleasure talking to you today And thank you for being on the ReadME Project", "Absolutely Thank you for having me", "Instead of a usual AskRMP this month we are getting advice from an authority in this space Kelsey Hightower We spoke to him last month in a wide ranging conversation but we specifically wanted to ask him about what its like working on Kubernetes for so many years What keeps that scale going in one of the most active GitHub communities Heres his advice on managing communities at this scale and what he learned that can apply to a project of any size", "When you get a project at the scale of Kubernetes and theres a couple of levels of scale One is like technical implementation candid scale to from  notes to  notes And theres the other scale of what happens when competitors all rely on the same technology Now you need legal help you need trademark help You need to discuss what happens with patents what happens with source code You have to think about bad actors at the government level people who have unlimited resources to put back doors into software", "If you miss that full interview with Kelsey Hightower during Maintainer Month head to githubcomread me to find it in our feed Or you can head wherever you listen to podcasts Its episode number ", "When you dive into the project if youre like me you get all jazzed on the code You want to see what people have done You want to learn you want to figure out how you can add your own spin or help the project be a little bit better But we also know that all the other stuff outside of the code is hugely important as well", "Were actually going to talk about non code contributions things like documentation education support and communitybuilding as well To talk more about this we have the ReadME Projects senior editor Klint Finley back in the mix Hey Klint its good to have you back", "Always good to be here Martin", "So why do you think people sometimes forget how important these noncode contributions are Why do many of us ya know guiltily just jump straight into the code", "Yeah Well I think its understandable and we do the same thing with commercial software We think about software companies largely as the conglomerations of developers rather than these things that have all these other people involved marketers graphic designers and technical writers and so forth", "Yeah Ive actually talked to a number of open source maintainers and they start off contributing the code and then with the community they actually get help with triage of bugs and things like that so they can stay focused on the code Did you have a chance to speak to some maintainers about this", "Yeah so I talked to Sarah Rainsberger whos actually a core contributor to Astro the web UI framework But even though shes a core contributor her main contributions are actually in the area of support and community Heres what she had to say about it", "I run into open source projects all the time where the documentation is less than stellar really Why do you think that is Klint Whats happening there Whats going wrong", "And its also just a really good place to start in open source You need to understand a project before you can really jump in and start contributing code or doing other things So if you start by just reading the documentation finding the things that are unclear the things that need to be updated you can start by fixing those things and contributing in that way before you jump in and try to do something else", "Well Astros a web framework And Sarahs obviously very technical I mean she leads Astros docs work as a core maintainer She builds her own websites with Astro So youre seeing that people who are codes and have these technical skillstheyre still helping projects in ways that arent through code", "Support is another area Its very technical You need to understand the project you need to understand how people are using it In a lot of cases you probably do need to understand even the underlying code Thats another really good place to get started with open source because you can get started right away just by answering peoples questions with no poll request required heres what Sarah had to say about her work doing support", "I think of myself as being very close to what our users are doing They are not trying to learn how to build a website platform or framework They are trying to build a website Are the docs written in such a way that when you type something in search you are getting useful results Thats not a code contribution but that absolutely is essential to people who are trying to code with our project", "And as you said Sarah is very technical but she also makes the point that not only can coders contribute to noncode aspects of a project but that getting started contributing to open source can be challenging even for experienced developers", "It can be quite overwhelming for people whether or not you have a code background People sometimes think that newbies to open source mean newbies to code but thats not the case There are some really experienced devs who need help being walked through the process of actually submitting a poll request and what that looks like how to commit a suggestion that they receive", "Thats fascinating to hear and Im sure plenty of projects would love people to kind of help out in these areas How do you actually go about attracting these types of contributions into your community in the first place", "Yeah so I think one of the big ways is just letting people know the work that there is to be done Lots of people want to contribute to open source and they dont know where to start So marking some of these noncode related issues with help wanted or good first issue is just a great place to start And heres what Sarah had to say about cultivating noncode contributors", "Astro from the very beginning from the top down valued our community and our docs Not all open source projects have a docs lead but by showing from the top what is valued in the communityand I am one of the big peeps in the community yet Im just the docs leadthat shows what the project values and that shows that your contribution will be valued because theres someone there that you can see in an upper position whos being supported", "We at Astro also happen to have a very tight docs and dev integration So in short one thing you can do is just value from

is exciting", "I didnt expect you to say that", "I think that goes for both of us", "Regardless were going to be taking a closer look at web standards and conventions and how we come to a consensus around those when a new technology emerges especially in open source where there are no limits to who your community is which adds a special layer of complexity around making decisions And one of the things that were going to be talking today about is TypeScript which Martin I know you have some history with", "Well yeah it was a super small part The reason Microsoft have an account on GitHub which I created was actually for the TypeScript project to open source And Ive got this vivid memory of Anders Hejlsberg and Amanda Silver coming to me and saying Hey were going to release this new JavaScripty thing Its going to be amazing The worlds going to adopt it And I remember coming in Yeah right Okay good luck with that", "Well just goes to show you should never bet against Anders Hejlsberg or Amanda Silver thats for sure", "I cant believe you created the Microsoft GitHub account Its like a flex which I think is totally valid and I think whats really interesting about that is that things change over time Now TypeScript has become pretty ubiquitous and its the fourthmost popular language in GitHub and theres still some limitations Were going to be talking to GitHubs Mike Melanson about the rise of static type checkers the pros and cons and how the standards could change soon", "Yeah and well also be diving back into how technology is changing especially for developers with disabilities This time AI is playing a role Well talk to Aaron Gustafson from Microsoft about all that", "Plus as always well hear about what is going on at The ReadME Project and get some advice in AskRMP but first first commit", "Picture if you will with me Neha the world of stock traders Now what that probably conjures up is the view of New York Stock Exchange People crowded screaming at each other wearing blazers and maybe its like the futures exchange with Eddie Murphy in Trading Places or something like that", "Honestly in todays day and age I absolutely cannot imagine it because it sounds nothing but stressful for me But luckily in actuality today it sounds a lot more like this", "But that makes sense because over time the world of financial trading has increasingly left their pocket calculators behind and begun relying more and more on computers and other technology So as the algorithms advanced the trading floor got quieter", "Yeah and actually today the world of trading is so automated and fast because of the use of powerful computers These arbitrage opportunities are found and executed in the milliseconds and fractions of milliseconds between trades So youve guessed it this requires some pretty powerful computers to take advantage of it", "And in the early s milliseconds really started to matter Michael Lewis wrote about this in his book Flash Boys that organizations were increasingly getting the upper hand in this battle of time with better software and even better physical infrastructure that was slightly closer to the Stock Exchange itself And were talking a few feet of cable making the difference", "And the ability of these firms to conduct superfast trades they owe it at least in part to open source In that same time period Linux was being quickly adopted by many in the financial sector to power their highspeed trading systems Because of the systems ability to send messages really quickly some have even argued that highfrequency trading wouldnt exist without Linux and without open source", "Even today the New York Stock Exchange which is the biggest stock market in the world is run on GNU Linux and Linux was also beneficial because it allowed these companies to continually improve performance and speed giving them the upper hand and making the billions", "Of course there are some downsides to the dependence on fastmoving automated systems like this Weve seen a few times where a small error can actually cause a whole market to dip Back in  the Knight Capital Group lost around  million during a mass selloff of stocks That happened by accident because of a proprietary software glitch that got pushed to production", "And while this kind of highfrequency trading has become the standard in markets people continue to innovate and the technology continues to develop Today algorithmic trading accounts for around twothirds of US equity trading for example And with the growth of AI the speed and power of some of this kind of financial trading will only get bigger", "So Neha I mentioned it in the intro but Ive been around TypeScript for a little while now and its become this really important tool that we all depend on not just for the systems that we write here at GitHub but also for a lot of the systems that were using on the internet today", "Yeah I feel like TypeScript is something we use a lot at GitHub and I actually started playing around with it as a developer before I joined GitHub and I really liked it because it brought some order into how we were working and making sure that we were speaking about the same things in the same type of way especially because we werent all working as closely together It allowed us to hand things off to each other in a very effective way", "Yeah It really excels when youre working in a large team Some of those static errors kind of show up a lot more when youre collaborating with interfaces somebody else wrote", "Were going to dive a bit more into how TypeScript became so popular and where it goes next Mike Melanson is joining us Hes the senior editor of The ReadME Project and hes back with us now Hey Mike", "Hey hows it going Martin", "Its great to have you here A lot of people have kind of used TypeScript now In the last Octoverse Report its like the fourthmost popular language on GitHub now but thats come a long way in a very short period of time Do you want to give a quick history about some of the background and where this came from", "Theres been some swings in paradigms in programming languages over the years and if you go back to the very beginning you have Fortran and COBOL some of the very first languages and they came out and they were statically typed and that meant that those languages checked the types which is Boolean string integer It checked that the types matched the operations that are being run on them during compiled time That was the dominant thing for a long time because it helped companies find certain types of errors and do certain things", "And then the web came about in the s and we had JavaScript show up We had Python PHP Perl Ruby all these different languages all dynamic where the checking happened at runtime Also the time of Agile happened And so like Facebook said at the time Move fast and break things these were the languages where you could move fast and you might break things but you were moving fast at least right", "Yeah But then companies like Google tried to make maps and docs in JavaScript and Microsoft realized early on that they were going to have to bring the Microsoft Office suite to the web and when they realized that and that they would have to use JavaScript to do it because that was the language of the web by then they said basically No way Were going to have to find a better way to do this and they built TypeScript", "I think thats always amazing to me the computer science that happens to solve internal engineering problems at companies Its a lot of the reason why we have things like codespaces and some of the things on GitHub is to solve our own problems", "Neha you were actually using this back in the day Did you find that it was helping you resolve a whole set of issues when you were coding in TypeScript versus just raw JavaScript", "I did So to put myself out there a bit when I was working at Pivotal and we were working with different companies and trying to basically make sure that on day two and three we were picking the right languages and frameworks that would work with these teams we were pairing together but we would just completely merge to main We wouldnt actually have to do a code review or any of that formal processes", "And I think theres something really interesting here As Mike said you have to move fast and break things We wanted progress and then we wanted scale And if you want scale you need some constraints and order to make that scale happen It was the biggest criticism of JavaScript was not having types and not being able to scale beyond a certain level and needing to adapt something else but now you didnt have to", "And one of the things about TypeScript is that it helped do that but without going all the way back to the Java and the C You didnt have to write all that boilerplate code and the big interfaces and think all just in abstractions You could still have that sort of selfdocumenting feature that youre essentially talking about and all those other things but not go back to what some people at that time saw as the dark ages", "Well Id say some people were quite skeptical about this at the time There was a reason why we created dynamically typed languages or dynamic languages to be fast So everybody cant be a fan of doing it this way are they", "No not necessarily I talked to Jordan Harband about this and hes a member of TC which is the committee that determines ECMAScript the standard behind JavaScript And he definitely acknowledges the benefits of type systems but he also says that types can essentially become a crutch that you rely on in place of doing proper testing on your code", "Yeah just because you are typesafe doesnt mean you are safe from bugs I have plenty of bugs in my TypeScript code", "Yeah for sure Types help you find them during development You have a tighter feedback loop often but things still slip past Here are some of the downsides Jordan told me about", "The cons of a type system I think are less objective and less broadly understood or agreed upon TypeScript is not a superset of JavaScript It does not have the capability to fully represent JavaScript semantics You can have programs that type check that still throw type errors and you can have programs that TypeScript complains about that do not in fact throw type errors These are edge cases theyre rare but it happens", "Normally when presented with these sorts of caveats the response is Well its good enough for my use case and thats a valid choice one can make but its still a con to consider Youre adding complexity to your code base youre adding more requirements on your developers to understand the code to maintain it And when the errors are confusing or incorrect it can take a lot of extra time and more importantly mental energy and focus to stop what youre doing figure out what the problem is and then keep moving", "Another big con though is that a lot of people are under the impression that having these static types means that youre safe They use the phrase typesafe but youre not actually safe at all TypeScript provides zero runtime guarantees All its doing is kind of giving you hints I think its really important that folks understand that theres basically no bugs youll catch with TypeScript that you couldnt have caught with tests and shouldnt have caught with tests", "I think that some of those points are really fair I think that whenever you try to solve for some areas youre making compromises in others", "When it comes to how the general community has responded are there any other criticisms that are prevalent and have you seen the TypeScript community respond in any way", "Yeah I mean I would say overall people love TypeScript right It tops the charts on various surveys but at the same time theres one part that nobody really likes and thats the build step Gil Tayar was the original author of the Type Annotations Proposal for JavaScript and that proposal is to bring essentially types as comments to JavaScript with the idea that you wouldnt have that transpilation step that TypeScript has Its definitely all about the build step", "Recently a highprofile thing happened Svelte framework creator Rich Harris announced on Twitter that he was foregoing TypeScript to use JSDoc instead And I mean theres another instance of pros and cons You can skip the transpilation step there but the con is that you have this sort of disjointed separate experience now where your types are held in this other doc or this other So theres always pros and cons", "The Type Annotations Proposal looks to get rid of that and it really tries to find a way to make JavaScript itself more of a gradually typed language rather than having TypeScript on top And it also actually wants to make it so that you can use various type systems on top of JavaScript Its supposed to be just sort of an inbetween layer where you could choose your type system to be TypeScript or you could choose it to be Flow from Facebook or you could choose Hegel I think was another one", "And thats definitely what we see isnt it Were seeing not just an increasing move to kind of typing in JavaScript but also the flexibility of dynamic languages with the ability to do typing when you need it in other languages as well", "Yeah A thing thats been happening ever since TypeScript showed up in  has been this move towards a gradual type system I think the phrase first came out in  in an academic research paper but gradual typing basically is finding the best of both worlds and thats really the story of TypeScript", "Yeah and thats fascinating because Amandas in charge of a bunch of different languages including C and things and both C as well as Java these very strongly typed languages have actually been adding features to allow them to be more dynamic So its amazing how the dynamic languages are getting more typesafe and then the typesafe languages are getting more dynamic and were kind of meeting in the middle and allowing people just like Neha said people to pick the right tool for the job at the right time", "Yeah precisely It really seems like were realizing we want the best of both worlds and the languages have been following that towards the middle a little bit", "Well I think thats a great ending though actually seeing how these languages have evolved meeting in the middle and making sure that people have the tools that they need to optimize for what they need", "Mike Melanson thank you so much", "Oh hey Mike before you run let us know what else is going on at the ReadME Project", "This month we have Kyler Middleton sharing how she went from farm life to a career in DevOps and outlining the overlooked value of knowledge sharing in tech Also Ruth Ikegah is back with a guide that simplifies making your first open source contribution And Tramale Turners guide helps you grasp adaptive leadership where your leadership style is responsive to the needs of your teams and organization You can find all this and more on githubcomreadme", "So Martin we cant really escape the conversation around AI right now There are a lot of worries about what its going to mean for our jobs and for society but there are obvious benefits too Were going to check back on a topic we covered a few months back which is accessibility because its one of the places that AI is poised to make a huge difference Its going to help create new systems standards and ways of working that not only benefit those who need accessible services but also the rest of the open source community", "And to talk about that today were joined by Aaron Gustafson Principal Accessibility Innovation Strategist at Microsoft Hey Aaron", "Its great to have you here I think thats a fancy title youve got So I think itd be helpful to start by explaining what your job actually entails What brought you into this role", "Gosh thats a tough one because Ive sort of had a long and winding journey in terms of technologies but I recently joined this team I guess recently to me about a year ago a little over a year And I came into this role from a history in accessibility in the web space And so a lot of my work has been in the space of accessibility progressive enhancement that sort of work trying to ensure that our web products can reach as many people as possible", "And then this opportunity came up on the Accessibility Innovation team at Microsoft and they were looking for somebody to steer the direction of the AI for Accessibility Grant Program which is a grant program thats just completed its fifth year where weve been doing a lot of targeted investments in research in startups and in organizations that are using AI and doing other things to really accelerate accessibility innovation across the globe", "I love that There was a bit of a tone of surprise when I was introducing you about this connection between AI and accessibility I just dont think its a natural connection that people might be thinking about So Im curious for you how do AI and accessibility connect", "Yeah so I would say theres a lot of disparate projects that are happening in this space The big projects like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT and stuff like that kind of capture a lot of the publics attention but there are lots of really interesting things that are going on and have been going on for a while that are using machine learning in different ways to address real needs", "So an example from a past grantee from the AI for Accessibility Grant Program is Mentra and they are a job placement platform and sort of ecosystem for people who are neurodiverse and their whole idea is to try and make the recruitment process better on both sides for both people who are neurodiverse and the people who want to hire neurodiverse employees for all the benefits that they bring to a place", "Yeah We had a talk a few weeks ago with Becky Tyler who uses texttospeech as a way of communicating with the world and shes a young teenage developer in Scotland And for me it was sort of noticeable that shed chosen a voice that didnt have a Scottish accent because it was a voice that was young and so being able to get these accents into people being able to have globally diverse different ways of communicating is important", "And you mentioned in our introduction that actually making these developments in AI accessibility more globally available has been an important part of your work Can you talk a bit more about that What does that mean Is it reducing affordability or is it increasing applicability to people who are outside of the US What is it", "I think theres a bunch of different things that kind of come together in that I think first of all yes availability And when we talk about availability globally were talking about cost were talking about necessary processing speed like what is the AI running on in terms of a device If its running on your local device can that be supported by devices that arent the latest and greatest shiny devices that people in the tech industry have in our pockets How can we ensure that as many people as possible are able to access these various technologies", "So another example in this vein is a project called IWill which is looking to address the needs of people seeking mental health treatment in India Im not going to remember the exact stat but I think its something like there are  mental health professionals per  people in India something like that", "And so looking for projects like that that can do really amazing things is really what gets me excited about coming into the office well virtual office every day", "I think this is a really interesting example because the beauty of technology is that you can see a problem and you can try to solve it with technology instead of having to have people or other types of funding to scale to solve that problem And at the same time Im sure Im not the only one that initially when I hear a project like IWill I get a little worried too and Im like Okay were applying AI to this kind of thing", "So I think theres some fear thats associated with AI and I feel like this example really capitalizes that where theres the huge benefits and the fears at the same time Do you think those fears are valid and is it possible that AI could actually create more challenges around accessibility", "Absolutely I dont wear rosecolored glasses when it comes to AI I do see lots of potential opportunity for harms And so a lot of what our team is trying to look at is what are the potential harms out there How can we mitigate them", "In the case of the IWill Project it was really important to us that here was a project that was looking at cognitive behavioral therapy and actually addressing it in a Hindifirst way and theyre not doing a leap to translation to English where theres an existing data set of CBT therapy chatbottype stuff and then having to bridge back to Hindi where not only are you in introducing fragility in that translation piece in a really sensitive area of mental health but theres also the potential for an imposition of Western perspective into a CBT experience", "So if the data that its trained on is using ableist language then chances are the model is going to have an ableist perspective or other problematic perspectives It may not be distinctly casting people with disabilities or with particular disabilities in a bad light or saying that theyre not capable of something or something like that it might go to the other area of like Oh youre so inspirational and that sort of stuff which is equally problematic but not in quite the same way", "So we need to be cognizant of what are the potential harms We need to be red teaming these systems and seeing are we getting problematic responses from generative AI certainly in terms of whether thats text generation through large language models or whether thats images that are being created that are potentially harmful in terms of their representation And the same goes beyond accessibility to representation and diversity overall right", "No no I think the classic example there was when we started introducing machine learning and data analysis in our watches and things to make us more healthy We then have a watch that somebody in a wheelchair puts on and it tells them to stand up every five minutes when it was initially launched and things like this that we risk amplifying our own biases because of those training sets", "The classic example is when I look at some of these AI portrait studio picture things I always have this wacky Americanstyle smile that Im not used to because Im European and I have bad dentistry", "Aaron we talked a lot when we talked about accessibility in previous episodes around increasing accessibility for the web increasing accessibility in the tools that we use It doesnt just make the products better for people with disabilities it makes the product better for people like us who are temporarily not disabled And does AI tools as well is that also going to make for a better ecosystem for everybody do you think", "We were using Copilot a lot when we create our own documentation internally and actually what weve found is its helping us in creating alt tags for images and things We find it suggesting the alt tag for us and the alt text and then its sort of prompting people and reminding people to actually complete those things So Im already starting to see some benefits there but we also need to add those biases into the system as were building things to gently prompt things along and make sure we are encouraging those behaviors", "And I almost feel like in some ways bad alt text generation in those contexts is sort of a needling of you to be like Oh thats really bad I need to replace that alt text with something that actually makes sense and is going to be more usable And as a forcing function yes the ultimate alt text may not be great if youre just taking the image description that the AI is suggesting but if it prompts you to then actually go and tune that thats a good thing Thats a good forcing function", "Totally I mean I think a good sort of related version to that is could GitHub Copilot replace a developer Possibly if that developer is literally just going to Stack Overflow and pulling solutions whatever the first solution is that they find and drop it in there without any thought yes that developer is probably replaceable by AI but most developers arent that right We look to things for inspiration and we massage it to be whatever it is that we need in the context that were doing that", "I saw someone describe an LLM as a great improv partner and having that sort of relationship with a Copilot with an assistant that you could do that its sort of pair programming in a way but being able to do it on your own And so I do think theres a lot of potential in that for doing those sorts of things", "Yeah And in some ways I feel like the automation that becomes possible through AI is sort of like what a lot of developers whove built their own macros and things like that things that have automated away mundane tasks for them in order to streamline their day thats effectively taking that sort of a concept but making it available to anyone that they can basically try and automate away the mundane tasks in order to be able to focus on the things that actually require a lot of focus attention care intentionality et cetera", "Aaron Gustafson Principal Accessibility Innovation Strategist at Microsoft thank you so much for talking with us It was fascinating to talk through this And if you want to hear more from Aaron you can check out his developer story at githubcomReadME", "And now for AskRMP the place in the show where we grab a listener question from you and get an expert to give us fair advice", "This month Imani from Rwanda asks How do I encourage people to add noncode contributions in particular to my project And to answer that we have Kingsley Mkpandiok a user experience and brand identity designer and the design maintainer at the CHAOSS Project based in Nigeria", "We talk about documentation design community management and could be language translation So these are areas where noncode contributors can actually make open source contribution to their probably favorite project", "So as the design maintainer in the community where I contribute to Ive personally onboarded lot of designers to contribute to the project And so talking about UX design of course we also have brand design fixing up promotional designs for the brand and all that These are still under noncode contribution", "Now for documentation we didnt really have a more detailed documentation to guide newbies just joining the community to help understand what we are doing better So personally what I did was to open a document and a Google Doc to be specific and I shared my own idea on how I understood the project and also made the document accessible to other old contributors And most of them also started sharing their own insight to different aspects of the project they understood better", "So eventually we now have this document where newbies joining the project can go through and have a preferred understanding of what the project is about and make the whole onboarding experience smooth So for me I think this is actually one of the ways I actually got people involved in documentation and also talking about design I know lots of persons also started contributing to a style guide a design system at CHAOSS Project These are just some of the ways Ive been able to also influence other noncode contributors in my communities to start making these contributions", "Most persons feel like I dont really have this super technical skill to start making contributions or some persons feel their contributions are little kind of wont be noticeable because Im not changing codes Im not doing that So I think its also important to also understand that when we use the word inclusivity in the open source ecosystem its cut across any tech skill that can actually make a project better So irrespective of what you feel whatever skill you think you have and you feel like Oh this is not really relevant I think its really really important", "And particularly for someone like me that loves advocating for designers in the open source ecosystem its also important for a lot of designers to understand that lot of open source projects out there the experience are not really like excellence and we need more and more designers in the open source ecosystem to improve on the experiences of this product which will actually encourage more persons to start using open source product", "So these are some of my tags on how noncode contributors should really get engaged and not really bother so much about Oh my experience or my skill is too small or not a super technical skill and wont really count Your skill counts", "Do you have a burning question about open source software development or GitHub Share it on social using the hashtag AskRMP thats ASKRMP and it may be answered in our next episode", "Thats it for this months episode of The ReadME Podcast Thanks so much to this months
